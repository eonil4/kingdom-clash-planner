Fix failed unit tests, and retest all ones until there is no failed one:
1. always use the following command to list failed tests:
```
pnpm test:unit 2>&1 | Select-String -Pattern "failed"
```
2. fix tests one by one with test isolation
3. check linter
4. repeat from "point 1" until there is no failed test
5. check code coverage
6. add a few more test cases to increase code coverage, then make sure the code passes
